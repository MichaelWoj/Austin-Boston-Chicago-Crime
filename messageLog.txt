Yo are we gonna be able to finish the data doc
Brendan said they sent theirs few days ago to get feedback and he said "a lot of improvements to be made"

Let's try finishing that doc today?
07/10/2019, 20:53
We can't really use Crime prediction: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15614263.2014.972618 as a citation source cause in order to access it you'd need to buy it for like €37
i see
we can prob roughly say that look 80 per cent of crime happens hear every oct last 5 yrs blah blah
I'm doing the references right now so can't really say shit beside the references
Also get to work @Martynas Daoneandonly🔫
LULW
We can abuse the "expect" word and say a bunch of shit we expect to do
like greg said, then in final report say well actually that didnt work heres what we did
Ye ye ye but really do you part today so I can upload it to github
As in before 23
07/10/2019, 23:49
loos good
Just gonna put it in here in case we need it for the future and resolve it on the actual document
sorr whatdya mean?
As in it no longer appears on the doc
oh yep
i wouldnt go tmrw if it wssnt foe this doc
Did he say what format it needs to be uploaded into github ?
sori no idea
does it have to be?
I think so
i know final doc will have to inc github where we save all our stuff
oh!
yeah ?
shoukd we writw github link in this doc?
or will the notebooka be saved on jupyter
then guthub not needed idk
No fucking clue fam
ah whatever
I'll just leave it till tomorrow and ask some nerds in class cause its not due until 13

@yall, I was able to add the google doc link to the readme on my github, 
@Michal Wojnowski
 thoughts?
I mean sure but we'll still have to see what he says in class
I mean he said that we can just email it to him
08/10/2019, 13:18
@Bernard Steemers
 I've added the few sentences to the scope,@ me if you want me to change it in any way or need me to do something
08/10/2019, 14:44
Having trouble with the wifi again in here, what i can see looks good. Ive added a small but onto data protection if there's anything you want to edit at all
I'll take a quick look at the changes now
I would say we could change the heading from GDPR to just Data Protection
My thoughts exactly
It all looks good to me
Unless you guys want to add or change something I would say we can send it to greg
Think we could change the title?
What do you want to change it to?
Somethiny shortish and descriptive
yeah that one looks good
Feel free to change or play around with it
We're both finished on our end i think
The Mapping and Analysis of Felony Location and Time using Machine Learning?
Or rather The Analysis and Aggregation of Felony Location and Time using Machine Learning
Cause we're not really mapping or predicting anything
Yeah that sounds better
Alright done, everyone happy with what we have ?
Yeah all good on our end
Alright, I'll send it to Greg then

Alright boys a three things, 1. 
@Bernard Steemers
 could you do the "Research and/or functionality specification which may include..."  as we are starting to run a bit tight on time and 2. what was architecture suppose to be and 3. don't put comments on the table of contents as they disappear after the table is updated
Hey 
@Michal
, i removed my part from the google document so i could work on it without it 3 people editing at the same time
I'll paste what i have back in when I'm finished
Alright cool
Architecture is a heading on the brief
Its below objectives
Oh yeah, so who actually was suppose to do that
It wasnt there before so it wasnt allocated
yikes
I think functionality covers architecture so i think we're ok
Alright cool, we'll just change the name to Functionality and Architecture
What time is this due tomorrow
Do we email it or what?
He hasn't said, I would say assume its for 11 so we don't leave work for tomorrow only to find out we only have like 2 hours to do it all
he hasn't said either, I'll ask him in class but my guess is email it to him and give him a physical copy for an external
Dont forget he wants to see references and pictures in this doc
We have references from the previous document but I really have no idea what to put down for pictures
@Bernard Steemers
 
@Michal Wojnowski
 are we okay right now? can i go sleep
Nah I don't allow you to ever go to sleep again
I concur
jsut gave me and idea for potential probs/issues - teammates prohibiting other team8s from sleeping
But nah I think we should be good for today
kk
im so pissed left my one of my straps in gym
so retarded they were literally on my wrists in locker room how the fck do i not put one in the bag
every time i tlak to some1 I zone out completely
rip
second time i forget them, last time they were gone had to buy new ones
absolute dumbfuck
Just remember we're gonna have to print out the chat logs and put them in the final report :v
alrgiht alrgiht
18/10/2019, 08:47
Guys im running late ill be in for half 9
Alright no worries
18/10/2019, 13:03
need to improve referencing at some point; either [number] or quotes format
We dont have quotes
this is a peace of text ("ref goes here") I think thats how holly did it
@Martynas Daoneandonly I'm gonna head to the gym now, once you're done we'll just do a full overview of the document to see if everyone is happy
agreed 
@Michal Wojnowski
, let me know when you're back. I'm on top floor of library.

I feel so inspired that I could do anything rn
[SUGGESTION] - add more images, graphs, pictures etc.
Do we have any images ?
a few, could add more
I haven't seen it so I'll default to your judgement
@bernardo we out btw, cya monday - squad signing off
18/10/2019, 17:03
Everyone happy with the specification ?
ill be adding  info latr on
Alright
@Martynas Daoneandonly will you put your most recent writings under its own headings? It just looks a little disjointed
ok
Thank ya kindly
Let me know when you do so I can edit the introduction
18/10/2019, 21:34
@Martynas Daoneandonly How are you edits going ?
awesome Michal im glad you asked!
yourself?
You done :v
i will replace the pre processing and alg bits with the new text, thoughts?
Gotta submit it before 12
Thanks for the reminder Bernard, appreciate it!
I'm good with it what's there
Alright, then I will proceed with replacement. I will attempt to fix referencing. Thanks for your patience guys!
I will also mention frontend technologies to be used very quickly. I am looking forward to it!
I rathee you didnt replace everything i wrote
If thats ok?
No problem you're right! I will remove the extra stuff, I was trying to add more detail having both doesn't make sense.
I don thnk theres any need to remove anything
Its all relevent material
Thoughts?
The bits I wrote earlier are saying what you got but more detail, having both is just saying same thing again.
Yeah I think its good, think just need to add references if we have any
I think both can exist independently under different headings.
Michael your vote is the decider,what do you think?
I'll have a quick reread over it and it'll tell you
I would say it looks pretty good as it is but the new references need to be fixed
An hour and a half to go lads. Can i send this onto him?
1 sec
Yeah I'm good to go whenever Martynas finishes his thing
If you want to go to sleep or have something to do I'll send it on
im done
Grand
Ill send it now
Ill also upload it to github
Alright cool
Good job bois
Thats done
Ill print a hard copy on tuesday
22/10/2019, 12:31
Design around the machine learning
kk
Holly asked him what the new topic is suppose to be and its what he said
gotcha
Full design of the application, describe in detail what you'll do with the data,  based on the detail a random person should be able to implement it
24/10/2019, 21:27
You bois coming in tomorrow ?

"Hi Bernard,
I can meet your group at 2pm in Room C202 if you wish.
Regards,
Greg"
Does this suit ye?
I have a meeting with Paul at 2.20
Yeah should be fine
At least for me, Martynas says he has a meeting with Chris at 2
Ok what will i say to him it doesnt work? We can run it by him Friday?
I would say let's do the meeting and just get things off Martynas he wants to know and ask him. There's no point in wasting this Thursday
Right
Quick 5 minute meeting
Ill let him know
06/11/2019, 13:56

07/11/2019, 18:00
Right lads imma write up about jupyter notebook, ill probably keep it in a seperate document and add it to the google shared file after
Alright cool, I'm probably gonna do Numpy
Riteo see ye in the morning
08/11/2019, 10:52
me write on pandas
You write pandas good marty
Did ye speak with greg lads?
I spoke to him for a moment just to check if what I was writing was right and he said it was fine just needed to add a few things like what is data pre processing, what is it in the context of the project and what were the options cause I talked about what we chose, why we chose it and it's features in what I already wrote
Alright cool sounds good,ive my paragraph done but there's some tips in there that i might use to add extra content. Anything other news or decisions ye decided on with proj today?
Nah nothing really new, everything has been pretty much set
Alright cool ill add my para into the google doc later, then maybe we'll devide up the remaining technologies? What are yer thoughts on headings apart from technologies?
We should probably add a plan of how we'll develop yet but I'm not quite sure how
How would ye feel about each having a go at import a data set each into jupyter notebook?
Importing*
I mean it sounds like effort but we should probably try it
Ahahaha my thoughts exactly:P
@Martynas Daoneandonly thoughts?
Right now his thoughts are on the squat rack
Ah ok
Are ye both in the gym?
Yeah, I'm replying in between sets
So this is your thumb workout:P
Sure we'll see how the weekend goes anyway, message the group if either of ye have any ideas on other headings
Yeah, over the weekend I'll probably work mostly on my project cause I have my meetings with Joe on Tuesdays so have to have something to show him
Yeah same as for me really, see how the weekend goes sure!
Should be grand anyway
12/11/2019, 09:02
You bois coming today ?
me no
I'm doing Plotly
12/11/2019, 12:11
K-Means, K-clustering, SKLearn, Anaconda are left to do
Ill do sklearn
13/11/2019, 10:07
Brendans group have use case diagrams, sequence diagrams etc done
greg was heavily in favour of having them
this doc apparently is like a guideline for a random to be able to replicate the product we're doing
ill have try at few diagrams should take few mins
19/11/2019, 12:36
Presentation slide ideas:
1. Intro (project topic, why is the topic worth researching?)
2. Data set sources / sizes / why these specificaly?
3. Technologies (Python, Anaconda etc.)
4. Proposed website (what will it include?)
5. Current phase
6. What's working / what's not, what changes had to be made
Gregs notes: Proposal,design,specification, 3mins each(10mins for group) we must work on Machine Learning techniques.
03/12/2019, 09:09
whos covering tech in presentation?
Ill do it
which ones?
All of them

@Martynas Daoneandonly
@Michal Wojnowski
I'm applying KMeans to the dataset. Finally got it properly preprocessed yesterday after the battle with the DISTRICT column
The first tutorial I sent saved my ass when it came to it so if anyone has problems with non-numeric data take a look or let me know and I'll give you the code
Thurs 11:58
Any progress bois ?
not yet
Thurs 13:13
How're you getting on 
@Michal Wojnowski
 ?
I'm stuck on visualizing the clusters in plotly
Is it a big issue? Whatre you trying to plot?
I wouldn't say big but just annoying cause I just can't find how to do it properly
I've run the data through k-means and divided it into 4 clusters, now i'm just stuck on actually displaying the clusters
Thats not a huge issue then if the results are there.
